Hello, this is Huimin Zeng (曾惠民 in Chinese)! I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Dong Wang](https://www.wangdong.org/). Prior to that, I graduated with M.Sc. degree in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence with Distinction from Technische Universität München in 2021. I received my B.Sc. in Robotics and Automation from Tongji University in 2018.

My research interest lies in trustworthy machine learning, NLP and recommender systems.
